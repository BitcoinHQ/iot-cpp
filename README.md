============================================

This C++ Client Library can be used to simplify interactions with the [IBM Watson IoT Platform] (https://internetofthings.ibmcloud.com). The documentation is divided into following sections:  

- The [Device section] (docs/c++_cli_for_devices.rst) contains information on how devices publish events and handle commands using the C++ ibmiotf Client Library. 
- The [Managed Device section] (docs/c++_cli_for_manageddevice.rst) contains information on how devices can connect to the Watson IoT Platform Device Management service using C++ ibmiotf Client Library and perform device management operations like firmware update, location update, and diagnostics update.
- The [Gateway section] (docs/c++_cli_for_gateway.rst) contains information on how gateways publish events and handle commands for itself and for the attached devices using the C++ ibmiotf Client Library. 
- The [Gateway Management section] (docs/c++_cli_for_managedgateway.rst) contains information on how to connect the gateway as Managed Gateway to IBM Watson IoT Platform and manage the attached devices.
